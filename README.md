## Overview
---
  **'Blog Git'** is a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developers’ posts as well. The application will feature ```API``` calls for the ```GET```, ```PUT```, ```POST``` and ```DELETE``` methods. 
  This application was designed based on the ```MVC``` concept, specifically utilizing the dynamic ```JavaScript``` and  ```HTML``` languages with dependencies on ```MySQL```, ```Express.js```, ```Handlebars```, ```Dotenv```, ```Bcrypt``` & ```Sequelize```.

  **'Blog Git'** features a functionality for a user to enter, comment-on, update and delete blog posts along with images. Additionally, the application will allow administrators to access a dashboard feature displaying all of user's blog post identifying data. Lastly, a user can gain access to all of the features w/in **'Blog Git'** by creating an account via ```login-in``` information securely stored using ```cookie``` & ```HTTP``` related processes which are all ran through ```Heroku```, the deployed application's location.
